                <h1>About our time</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello, cyber-space explorers! Welcome to the digitally
                    disconnected yet wonderfully remote world of Carina and
                    Miguel, the virtual duo ready to conquer the universe (or at
                    least the internet)!
                </p>
                <h4>Who are we?</h4>
                <h5>Carina:</h5>
                <p>
                    The expert in pajama meetings, master in the art of
                    communicating through emojis and gifs. A devotee of thematic
                    playlists for every code written. If something goes wrong,
                    it's because her coffee is still being brewed.
                </p>{' '}
                <h5>Miguel:</h5>
                <p>
                    The intrepid navigator of bits and bytes, turning complex
                    codes into digital masterpieces. With a secret talent for
                    picking the perfect soundtrack for any work sprint, Miguel
                    is the beacon of stability in our ocean of online meetings.
                </p>{' '}
                <h4>What do we do?</h4> <h5>Carina:</h5>{' '}
                <p>
                    Specialist in solving bugs while balancing a cup of coffee.
                    If she can't solve a problem, it's because the internet
                    connection is slower than her morning thinking.
                </p>{' '}
                <h5>Miguel:</h5>{' '}
                <p>
                    When not coding, Miguel is busy maintaining sanity with a
                    hot cup of tea and some virtual meditations. Our virtual
                    motto: Programming with coffee, laughing heartily (even if
                    it's through a laughing emoji).{' '}

                <h4>Remote curiosities:</h4> <h5>Carina:</h5>{' '}
                <p>
                    Can recite the Wi-Fi password of any caf√© in town but
                    forgets their own name during video conferences. Firmly
                    believes that the best part of remote work is being able to
                    wear slippers all day.
                </p>{' '}
                <h5>Miguel:</h5>{' '}
                <p>
                    Can effortlessly navigate the intricate web of design
                    elements for our projects but might occasionally forget
                    where he left his favorite pen. Firmly believes that the
                    true essence of remote work lies in the freedom to infuse
                    creativity into every webpage, all while enjoying the
                    comfort of an ever-growing slipper collection.
